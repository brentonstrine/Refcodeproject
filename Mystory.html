<h2>My developer story</h2>
<p>My name is James Kalunga, i am originaly from central Africa, D.R.Congo. I came in the USA eleven years ago as refugee with my familly. My familly was resetled in Tucson Arizona, where i had a chance to attend high school. After high school i was granted a scholarship at GCU in Phoenix. I decided to relocate to Georgia in october 2018 and now here i am.</p>

<ol><li>As child growing up in the D.R. Congo i did not have access to computers until when my family and i flew to Uganda. I remember my first time touching a computer was when i escorted my friend to  internet cafe.</li>
<li>After the day i escorted my friend at the internet cafe i remember going back home and told my dad that i was interested in learning how to browse the internet but it is not free.</li>
<li>My dad was a little bit hesitant to pay someone to teach me how to use the internet, but then luckily my mom encouraged him by telling that i might find a part time job in the internet cafe if i take it serious.</li>
<li>I then enrolled in basic computer classes and made friendship with the gentleman who was working at the internet cafe in Uganda.</li>
<li>A few months after i started helping at the internet cafe and took advantage to learn more.</li></ol>
